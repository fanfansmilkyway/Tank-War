[BUG]
1. The background music doesn't cease even if the window is closed. (Cmd+Q on mac)
2. To determine whether a tank is destroyed, this action should be excuted on just one side of the player, not both(should be the side whose tank gets hit). Otherwise some contradiction may occur.
3. Sometimes unable to start the multiplayer game. It is probably due to the communication between the server and the client. (00005, START)
